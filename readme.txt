Diagnostics Microservice

This python microservice is part of the adaptive learnig as a service architecture to transform the platform orthografietrainer.net towards adaptivity.
It contains the diagnostics module that computes the sample ratio mismatch and logs the results. This helps to find out about the a/b test.
While no SRM is detected, the distribution of users among intervention groups is equal.
